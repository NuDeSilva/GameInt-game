# GameInt - Code-Breaking Game

GameInt is a number-based code-breaking game for two players, where one player hides a secret code and the other player attempts to guess it. In this implementation, the computer generates a random secret code, and the player must guess the code within a limited number of attempts. The game provides deterministic hints to guide the player toward the correct solution.

## Overview
GameInt is a fun and challenging game where the player must guess a 4-digit secret code randomly generated by the computer. Each digit corresponds to one of six colors: White, Blue, Red, Yellow, Green, and Purple. The player has 8 attempts to guess the code correctly. After each guess, the game provides hints to indicate how close the guess was to the secret code.

## How to Play
The game starts by generating a random 4-digit secret code.

The player enters a 4-digit guess, with each digit separated by a space.

The game provides hints after each guess:

Black Peg (1): Correct number in the correct position.

White Peg (0): Correct number but in the wrong position.

Blank: Incorrect number.

The player wins if they guess the code correctly within 8 attempts.

The player loses if they exhaust all 8 attempts without guessing the code.

The player can exit the game early by entering 0000.

Rules
The secret code consists of 4 digits, each ranging from 1 to 6.

Each digit corresponds to a specific color (see Color Map).

The player has 8 attempts to guess the code.

The game ends when:

The player guesses the code correctly.

The player uses all 8 attempts.

The player enters 0000 to exit the game.

## Color Map
The digits correspond to the following colors:

  Digit	  -   Color
- 1	      -   White
- 2	      -  Blue
- 3	      -   Red
- 4	      -    Yellow
- 5	      -   Green
- 6       -   Purple

## Hints
After each guess, the game provides hints using the following system:

Black Peg (1): The guessed number is correct and in the correct position.

White Peg (0): The guessed number is correct but in the wrong position.

Blank: The guessed number is incorrect.

Example:

Secret Code: 1 2 3 4

Player Guess: 1 3 5 2

Hints: 1 (Black), 0 (White), Blank, Blank
